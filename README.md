# Unhealthy Behaviors and Multiple Long Term Conditions (MLTCs) Statistical Analysis

This project examines the relationship between the number of unhealthy behaviors a person engages in and the time it takes to develop multiple long-term conditions (MLTCs) over 7 years. The unhealthy behaviors include smoking, physical inactivity, alcohol consumption, and obesity. The project also investigates the effect of sociodemographic (age, sex, cohabitation, ethnicity) and socioeconomic factors (wealth) on this relationship.

# Data
The dataset, "TaskB.dta," was obtained from a longitudinal study between June 2008 and July 2009. It comprises data from 1,989 participants who were asked to complete a baseline questionnaire collecting data on long-term conditions, sociodemographic variables, and health behavior variables. Follow-up interviews were carried out annually to check for any new long-term conditions. Once a participant reported two conditions, they were classified as having MLTCs. Participants who did not develop MLTCs were censored at the end of the follow-up period on 15th May 2015.

# Methodology
First, a new variable is derived from the number of unhealthy behaviors each participant reports.
Following this:
- Describe the sample and all variables in the dataset.
- Investigate univariate associations between all variables of interest and the development of MLTCs.
- Build a final model that includes all relevant variables for predicting time to MLTCs, providing statistical justifications for the choice of variables.
- Check the assumptions of the chosen model.

# Deliverables
The final report will include:
- Tables and interpretations of results.
- Descriptions of the sample and variables.
- Investigations of univariate associations.
- The final model with justifications and interpretations.
- A check of the model's assumptions.
- Summary of the interpretation of the findings, presented in layman's language for easy understanding.

# Usage
1. Make sure you have statistical software processing ".dta" files, such as Stata or R, with appropriate libraries.
2. Load the data from the "TaskB.dta" file.
3. Perform exploratory data analysis and prepare the data for modeling.
4. Choose an appropriate statistical model for the analysis.
5. Conduct the analysis, create the final model, and interpret the results.
6. Compile findings and interpretations in a report.
