# Multimorbidity Statistical Analysis Project
Project Overview
This project investigates the risk factors associated with Multimorbidity, i.e., living with multiple long-term conditions (MLTCs), among older adults in England, UK. The objective is to understand the relationship between the number of unhealthy behaviors a person engages in and the time it takes to develop multiple long-term conditions (MLTCs) over 7 years. The unhealthy behaviors include smoking, physical inactivity, alcohol consumption, and obesity.

The project will also explore how these factors vary according to socioeconomic status and the effect of sociodemographic (age, sex, cohabitation, ethnicity) and socioeconomic factors (wealth) on this relationship.

# Data
The data for this project is contained in two files: TaskA.dta and TaskB.dta.

TaskA.dta is a nationally representative sample of adults aged 50 and over living in England in 2008. It includes data on 24 different long-term conditions and various sociodemographic and health behavior variables considered potential risk factors for MLTCs. The 'MLTC' variable indicates whether a participant has been diagnosed with two or more conditions, thereby living with MLTCs.

TaskB.dta was obtained from a longitudinal study between June 2008 and July 2009. It comprises data from 1,989 participants who were asked to complete a baseline questionnaire collecting data on long-term conditions, sociodemographic variables, and health behavior variables. Follow-up interviews were carried out annually to check for any new long-term conditions. Once a participant reported two conditions, they were classified as having MLTCs. Participants who did not develop MLTCs were censored at the end of the follow-up period on 15th May 2015.

# Analysis and Report Guidelines
The analysis and report for this project should include the following sections:

Descriptive Presentation: Overview of the dataset, including descriptive statistics and visualizations of the variables.

Univariate Associations: Investigation of univariate associations between all variables of interest and the development of MLTCs.

Model Building: Build a final model that includes all relevant variables for predicting time to MLTCs, providing statistical justifications for the choice of variables.

Assumption Checking: Check the assumptions of the chosen model.

Outcome Regression Model: A simple linear regression model is used to estimate the relationship between unhealthy behaviors and the time to develop MLTCs.

Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW): Use IPW to adjust for baseline confounders and estimate the relationship between smoking cessation and BMI change.

G-Formula: Estimate the BMI change after 5 years if a) no one had quit smoking and b) all individuals had quit smoking. This will give the average causal effect of smoking cessation on BMI change after 5 years.

Interpretation of Results: The findings are presented in layman's language for easy understanding.

# Usage
- Ensure that statistical software can process ".dta" files, such as Stata or R, with the appropriate libraries installed.
- Load the data from the "TaskA.dta" and "TaskB.dta" files.
- Perform exploratory data analysis and prepare the data for modeling.
- Choose an appropriate statistical model for the analysis.
- Conduct the analysis, create the final model, and interpret the results.
- Compile your findings and interpretations into a report.
